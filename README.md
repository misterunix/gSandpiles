# gSandpiles

I created a new [Abelian Sandpile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model)  program in Go. This time, I used the idea of growing the grid from my CPP version. I was pleasantly surprised when the Go version outperformed the CPP version.

Since I prefer programming in Go over C or CPP, I plan on sticking with this code base, adding features as I think of them. 

I am not sure if I want to do an all-out speed run on my unused I3 Ubuntu server, but I know I will. The largest center-filled model I have seen is 2<sup>30</sup> or 1,073,741,824 grains started in the center position. [Link](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~wes/sandgallery.html), but it doesnt say how long it took to run. 

Any suggestions or contributions are welcomed.
